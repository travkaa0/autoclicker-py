# Auto clicker

### ðŸ“Œ This is the simplest auto clicker that turns on when you press hot keys

ðŸ“– The auto clicker works using an endless while loop, with a delay of 0.01 to avoid freezes (of course, you can replace this delay if you wish).
When you turn the auto clicker on and off (which is done with the same key combination), it will display a corresponding notification in the console.
